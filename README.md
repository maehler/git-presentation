# An introduction to Git

This presentation was written for a technical seminar at the [Ume√• Plant Science Centre](https://www.upsc.se).

## Get this presentation

```
git clone https://github.com/maehler/git-presentation.git
```

Ironically enough, this repository contains submodules, but they are never mentioned in the presentation. If you want to view the rendered presentation these have to be loaded by running the following commands after cloning:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

or by simply cloning the repository recursively in the first place:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/maehler/git-presentation.git
```
